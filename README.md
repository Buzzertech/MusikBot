# MusikBot

This is an elixir/erlang rewrite of my project, (DatSongBot)[https://github.com/buzzertech/datsongbot], which is originally written in TypeScript and runs on NodeJS.

## Why a rewrite?
Well, it boils down to two things:
- A. I am learning elixir right now. It is being used at my current organization and the language really intrigues me into learning more. So, here we are!
- B. I am running out of project ideas

## Is this ready yet?
No, it is still a WIP but it doesn't matter either ways because this is just an experiment for me to deep dive into the language's semantics, to understand how it works, etc. with a project like this where the complexity is right at the sweet spot, neither trivial nor too difficult.
